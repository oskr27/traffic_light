Welcome to Traffic Light Recognition's documentation!
=====================================================

I personally appreciate you to come by and take a look at the Traffic Light Recognition's repository
documentation. If you do not know how to get started with your project, we recommend you to go and
check the Getting Started section below.

Last but not least, this project is a work in progress, and definitely the more feedback I receive
the better, so please, let me know any comments, questions, or discussions.
